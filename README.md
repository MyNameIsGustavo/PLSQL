    <h2>DML (Data Manipulation Language)</h2>
    <p align="justify">The "DML" directory contains examples and explanations of PL/SQL commands related to data manipulation. DML commands are used to retrieve, insert, update, and delete data in a database. In this directory, you will find implementations of the following commands:
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT: Retrieves data from one or more tables. This command allows you to use various clauses such as WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY, and INNER JOIN to filter, group, and sort data.</li>
        <li>INSERT: Inserts new rows into a table.</li>
        <li>UPDATE: Modifies existing data in a table.</li>
        <li>DELETE: Removes rows from a table.</li>
    </ul>
    Explore this directory to learn how to perform data manipulation tasks using PL/SQL.</p>

    <h2>DDL (Data Definition Language)</h2>
    <p align="justify">The "DDL" directory contains examples and explanations of PL/SQL commands related to data definition. DDL commands are used to create, modify, and delete database objects such as tables, views, indexes, and sequences. In this directory, you will find implementations of the following commands:
    <ul>
        <li>CREATE TABLE: Creates a new table in the database.</li>
        <li>ALTER TABLE: Modifies the structure of an existing table.</li>
        <li>DROP TABLE: Deletes a table and its associated data from the database.</li>
        <li>CREATE VIEW: Creates a virtual table based on the result of a query.</li>
        <li>CREATE INDEX: Creates an index on one or more columns of a table to improve query performance.</li>
        <li>CREATE SEQUENCE: Creates a sequence object for generating unique numbers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>PL/SQL Programming</h2>
    <p align="justify">The "PLSQL" directory contains examples and explanations of PL/SQL programming techniques. PL/SQL is a procedural language that extends SQL by adding programming constructs such as variables, control structures, and exception handling. In this directory, you will find implementations of the following concepts:
    <ul>
        <li>Variables and Constants: Declaring and using variables and constants in PL/SQL.</li>
        <li>Control Structures: Conditional statements (IF-THEN-ELSE, CASE) and loops (FOR LOOP, WHILE LOOP).</li>
        <li>Procedures and Functions: Creating reusable code blocks in PL/SQL.</li>
        <li>Exception Handling: Handling errors and exceptions in PL/SQL.</li>
        <li>Cursors: Retrieving and processing query results using cursors.</li>
        <li>Triggers: Implementing triggers for automatic execution of PL/SQL code in response to database events.</li>
        <li>Packages: Organizing related PL/SQL objects into packages for modular development and maintenance.</li>
        <li>Inner Joins: Combining data from multiple tables using inner join operations.</li>
        <li>Aggregate Functions: Using functions such as SUM, AVG, COUNT, MIN, and MAX to perform calculations on groups of rows.</li>
    </ul>
